The Feminist manual got me thinking. At first I didn’t understand the significance of this server, but when I looked into it, I found that it was necessary, especially in countries where women have no rights. “ETC began with a group of women who felt the need to learn technical skills in their own space, unhindered by the typical male geek competitiveness, to try and solve all problems with an open mind.” In many parts of the world, some women are not qualified to study at all, and the server provides them with a guarantee, providing a free learning platform free from male obstacles. In order to ensure the safety of the browser, the creator of the server made a lot of efforts, they considered many aspects, and discussed. As the article notes, “Thanks to The Feminist manual project, we have a better understanding of the considerations we can take into account in terms of security, privacy, accountability, fairness, public, censorship, (anti) archiving, and the ways in which we can care about them.” This is a great server, learning to program has many great implications.
