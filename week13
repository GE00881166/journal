International Journal of Market Research describes direct correlations among experience, emotion, and social media sharing. Their data suggest that the more participatory and emotional the art environment, the more people tend to share their feelings with others (Piancatelli et al. 2021). The study’s authors explain it this way: “Emotions induced in the museum context lead to increased levels of engagement that, in turn, affect visitor behaviors. The emotions–engagement–behavior relationship is particularly evident in contexts characterized by spectacular consumption” (Piancatelli et al. 2021).
I wonder if the exhibitions at the National Gallery are too ordinary, but as a national gallery, it has its own grandeur and splendor. When you walk in here, people go to see Van Gogh’s Sunflowers.This should also be the influence of the information age on the marketing of Van Gogh. His life experience and highly romantic psychosis make Van Gogh a topic, and his paintings thus find a selling point.
