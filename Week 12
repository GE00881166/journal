Assignment Part 2: Journal Entry Two (of two)
As an interstellar courier. There is no denying that the Krypton space station is one of the most in-demand and trendy.
The merchandise is not the most fashionable jewelry or clothing, and in such a tight interstellar world, aliens and humans rarely spend much money and time on a luxury item.
This space station is selling exactly what the universe needs most in this era, a product created by a group of disabled scientists, for example, the magic glasses that allow blind astronauts to travel in space, or the mechanical devices that replace missing limbs. 
 If you want to know why the goods on the Krypton space station sell best, it’s because the designers here can fully understand the needs of the disabled, and design the perfect products according to the needs, and here the recruitment conditions are very strict, requiring at least their own as a disabled person and for their own production of a number of life barriers to solve the device. 
  Unlike in the past, “Disability” is no longer a derogatory term, but on behalf of the knowledge and technology of disabled designers.
