Since the 1960s, when computer technology was still a buzzword, artists have tried to use programming to teach computers how to sketch and draw.
The artwork I’m working on is Harold Cohen.
 In 1973, the British artist Harold Cohen created AARON, a computer program that could create its own art. One of the earliest “artificial intelligence” painting programs became a pioneer in computer art because it relied on its “learning ability” to draw abstract closed shapes, still life objects, and even people without manual input.

To “teach” a computer how to draw like a human, Cohen began to wonder: How do artists process the information they want to convey when they create a painting that “resonates”? Therefore, Cohen began to study the earliest primitive cave murals and children’s paintings of human beings, so as to find their common “singularity”. Based on this, through a series of instructions, AARON gradually discovered and “understood” how human beings drew pictures in the process of self-learning, and then formed a set of his own style.

A new visual realm was born, and the computer began to become the new “palette” for artists.
